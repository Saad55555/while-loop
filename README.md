# while-loop (visual studio)

I performed following steps in Visual Studio:
● I created a while.py file.
● I wrote a program that continually asks the user to enter a number.
● When the user enters “-1”, the program stops requesting the user
to enter a number,
● The program then calculated the average of the numbers entered,
excluding the -1.
● I made use of the while loop repetition structure to implement the
program.
